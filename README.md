The Universal Turing Machine (UTM) is a theoretical construct introduced by Alan Turing in 1936, and was used to demonstrate the foundational concept of computational universality. A UTM is characterized by its capability to simulate the program of any Turing machine (including itself) given an encoded description of its states, alphabet, transition functions, starting state, accepting state and rejecting state. Our project focuses on building the framework to implement a theoretical single-tape Universal Turing Machine.
